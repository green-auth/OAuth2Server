# Introduction

This project serves as a practical, level-based learning resource for building an OAuth 2.0 server with Spring Boot. My aim is to explore the protocol and provide a series of working examples that demonstrate different levels of complexity.
The project is structured into progressive "levels," with each one represented by a dedicated branch in the repository. As you move through the branches, the complexity and feature set of the OAuth 2.0 server increase, offering a clear path from a basic implementation to a more robust one.
